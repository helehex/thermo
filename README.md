# Thermo Engine

A physics engine written in Mojo.

This is currently tied to my WIP game framework, but may be split eventually.

Currently uses Mojo nightly:  
`mojo 2024.8.2715 (fe1c27f0)`

To run the example, you need sdl for rending:
`sudo apt install libsdl2-dev`
`sudo apt install libsdl2-gfx-dev`
