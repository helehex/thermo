# TODO:

- Setting properties on b1 in contact has no effect
    - All contacts are currently duplicated because of this
- Find the ghost causing strange physics behaviour, maybe from cached impulses
- Fix contact math, stop using trig functions
- Better model for updatables, renderables
- Actual boxes, polygons, etc..
